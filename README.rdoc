= RailsMachine

Simple implementation of state machine for Rails greater than 4.1.

In this project we used Enums introduced in Rails 4.1.

== Usage


  class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
    include RailsMachine

    rails_machine do
      state :first_state # Not explicitly sets id to 1
      state :test, id: 10
      state :another # Not explicitly sets id to 11
      
      transition to: :another
      transition from: :another
    end
  end
